# WorldEdit: Bedrock Edition
This is a Minecraft Bedrock addon port of the famous WorldEdit mod for Minecraft: Java Edition. The addon comes with custom commands to make building easier, and more fun! Not only are there commands, but also items to make it easier for anyone on any device to use this.
__Please note that this addon is currently in its beta stage, and requires experimental features. To be on the safe side, make a backup of your world.__

## Installation
First you must download the mcaddon file. You can find one in the release section. After which, you open it with Minecraft and it will be imported into your game. Once there, choose a world you want to apply this addon to, and add the behaviour pack and resource pack together. The following experimental features must also be enabled.
